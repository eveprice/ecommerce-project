# Ecommerce

### I made it for study purposes, just to learn more about react, responsive design, rest APIs, routes, mongo database, express, mongoose and much more. This is a full stack application, with an back-end made in nodejs and a front-end made in reactjs.

## ðŸ’¾ Installing 

Git clone the repository

Create the mongo database

  - First, you will need to create a mongo database for the back-end, to do it, install mongo shell on your OS (Windows, Linux) and then open the shell using the <code>mongo</code> command, once it's opened, create a database called ecommerce using the following command:
    
    ```
      use ecommerce
    ```

  - Front end
    ```
    cd client/ | npm install
